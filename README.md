# UIProjectGeek

This user application was a test of technical skills on creating a UI using a new technology and following a set of expectations and instructions.

*DISCLAIMER/ PROJECT CLONE AND SET UP
This application works best with Android Studios and or Android stuidos emulators. Most of the functionality of the app was done on a 
Nexus 5 emulator API 28. The application also works with most android devices. I connected my Samsung s10 using my usb port and was able to download
the application to my phone. It was written in Java using the IDE android studios. This was a stretch in my programming abilites as I
wanted to challenge myself in better adapting my skills to an android development enviorment since after reviewing "Approachable Geek's"
website and application most of the projects were apps for mobile devices. 

Work began on the UIProjectGeek Monday 3/9/2020 I would spend 2 to 3 hours a night (after my campus classes were completed
researching and trying new techniques to understand how intents are created and how a child can send data to a parent using Java, while
also spending some time on contraints/ styling.

Not all the intents are fully functionally at the moment but it is well on its way to being a functionly app. I hope to continue to work on
this project this upcoming week to really nail down some more styles and become familiar working in Android studios as I feel in love this
technology and really enjoyed myself working on this project. 

I learned so much in this week taking this challenge and am proud of all that I was able to accomplish. It was busy with school, and work
but I really enjoyed the challenge and learning new things. Thank you Bruce and Garrett for this opportunity and I look forward to hearing
from you guys soon. What a fun project! :)
